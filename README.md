Unit Project #2: Feedr

I decided to work with The Guardian as my first news source/API. I have that hooked up and running, with the ability to click on an article and see the module. From there, you can click out to the article's link on Guardian. The search bottom on the home page allows you to click, but not to search. My plan is to continue working on this project after class is over so I can add more APIs and round out the functionality.
